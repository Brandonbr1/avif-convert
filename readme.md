This simply converts all Images to Avif upon upload. 

## Credits

This script is basically and copy paste of [Remove jQuery Migrate](https://github.com/icaru12/remove-jquery-migrate) by [icaru12/Hendy Tan](https://github.com/icaru12), and [This wordpress blog post and the code](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/23/wordpress-6-5-adds-avif-support/) almost none of the code was actually mines. So thanks to them, the plugin was able to be made!
